Orbot is the original free and open-source Tor-powered VPN for iOS and macOS. Orbot helps you access the internet with more safety and privacy, and no extra cost to you.

FEATURES:
- Browse the internet over Tor.
- Secure your traffic from insecure wireless networks and ISPs.
- Access .onion sites that are only accessible over Tor.

DISCLAIMERS:
- Web browsing is much slower than through a normal VPN because your traffic is encrypted and relayed through the Tor network.

- Orbot might not work on networks with advanced network restrictions. If the app does not connect, try using bridges (or a different type of bridge).

- Use of Orbot is at your own risk; remember that sensitive data does not always belong on a mobile device.

** Orbot is free and open-source software. You can read more about Orbot and how to support development of Tor on iOS by visiting orbot.app **
